## 📁 Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Collection & Understanding**
- Two datasets:  
  - **Lead Data**

  - Total Lead, Converted Accounts, Lead by Source and Stage  
  - Opportunity by Industry, Expected Amount, Trend Analysis

- Removed nulls and blanks in key fields  
- Standardized values (currency, date formats)  
- Created pivot tables for early summaries

### 3. **SQL Analysis (MySQL Workbench)**
Performed SQL queries for major KPIs:
- Expected Amount (in millions)
- Conversion Rate, Win Rate, Loss Rate
- Forecast vs Expected Revenue trend
- Active vs Total Opportunities
- Closed Won vs Total Closed

 ### Techniques used:
